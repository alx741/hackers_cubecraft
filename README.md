## Contributing

- Please send me pictures of your builds to: alx@sillybytes.net

- The `TODO` section lists the figurines that are to be created, the difficult
  part is to find a good enough picture of the person (resolution, front facing,
  illumination, funny [if possible], etc) so if you can find a good one please
  send it to me.

- You can always suggest a new one with a new _issue_.
