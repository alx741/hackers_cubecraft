Hackers Cubecraft
=================

This is a collection of funny **Cubecraft** figures of famous hackers, science
celebrities, personal idols, and other suggested relevant people.

These are used as desktop ornaments and are intended to be funny tributes.

All the figures are created using **GIMP** and you can find the _gimp_ source
files inside each `src` directory.

The images used for creating the figures are inside each `img` directory.

A thumbnail can probably be found inside each character directory.
